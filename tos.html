    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 12px; text-transform: uppercase; ">LAST REVISED: May 5th, 2023</p>

    <!--    <h2>Agreement Between User and Sentiment</h2>-->
    <p>
        Thank you for using the Sentiment platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as
        part of the platform (collectively, the “Service”). The Service is offered to you conditioned on your
        acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the "Terms"). Your use
        of the Service constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these terms carefully, and keep a copy
        of them for your reference.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Sentiment Service help inform better decisions by allowing you to discover, create, and interact with
        user posts that we call “claims.” Claims can be honed via subclaims and then voted upon to drive stronger
        alignment between you and others while simultaneously elevating everyone's voice in any decision-making process.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Your use of the Service is subject to Sentiment's <a href="../privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. Please review
        our Privacy Policy, which also governs the Service and informs users of our data collection practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Electronic Communications</h2>
    <p>
        Using the Service or sending emails to Sentiment constitutes electronic communications. You consent to receive
        electronic communications and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that
        we provide to you electronically, via email and as part of the Service, satisfy any legal requirement that such
        communications be in writing.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Account</h2>
    <p>
        If you use this Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and
        for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur
        under your account. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity. You
        acknowledge that Sentiment is not responsible for third party access to your account that results from theft or
        misappropriation of your account. Sentiment and its associates reserve the right to refuse or cancel service,
        terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion, for any reason at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Children Under Thirteen</h2>
    <p>
        Sentiment does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age
        of thirteen. If you are under 18, you may use the Service only with permission of a parent or guardian. Please
        have them read this Agreement with you. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under the age of 18, by
        allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject to the terms of this Agreement and responsible for your
        child’s activity on the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Organizational Use</h2>

    <p>
        If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organization, you represent and warrant that you have
        authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that such entity accepts this Agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>Government Use</h2>
    <p>
        If you are a U.S. Government end user, we are licensing the Sentiment Software to you as a "Commercial Item" as
        that term is defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (see 48 C.F.R. § 2.101), and the rights we grant
        you to the Sentiment Software are the same as the rights we grant to all others under these Conditions of Use.
    </p>

    <h2>Membership/Subscription Plans</h2>
    <p>As part of our Service, we may offer membership or subscription plans and may change them and their features
        from time to time. If you sign up for a membership or subscription plan, you agree to the terms, conditions and
        limitations associated with them that are posted on our websites or applications.</p>

    <h3>SNT Credits</h3>

    <p> As part of a purchase, membership plan, subscription plan, Service promotion, or otherwise, we may issue you SNT
        Credits ("Credits", “SNT Credits” or “SNT”) that can be redeemed in order to take certain actions on the Service
        (e.g., creating claim posts or voting on claims). SNT Credits may only be redeemed on the Service, have no cash
        value, are non-transferable and non-refundable. All SNT Credits are valid for a limited time as described in the
        applicable purchase, membership, subscription, or promotional terms and conditions. SNT Credits may be used
        after your membership or subscription has expired or been terminated, but Credits expire immediately upon the
        termination of your account.</p>

    <h3>Promotional and Membership Content</h3>

    <p> We may make content available to you from time to time through the Service for which a purchase is not required.
        You will have access to this content only for so long as we make it available generally or, where it is provided
        as a benefit of a membership or subscription plan, for so long as you remain an active member of your plan in
        good standing. We may also remove this content from your account, devices and applications or otherwise restrict
        your ability to access it.</p>
    <h3>Fees and Renewal</h3>
    <p> Fees for purchases, membership plans, subscriptions and other services will be stated at the time of your
        purchase or sign-up, as applicable, and provided in our help pages. The fees for purchases, membership plans, or
        subscription plans may change at any time. Fees may be subject to tax, collected by us or a third party through
        which you transact, and are non-refundable except in the specific circumstances described in these Terms. We
        only accept credit cards for payment of your membership or subscription fees. Please do not sign up for the
        program with a debit card. Also known as a "check" or "ATM" card, a debit card typically has the word "debit"
        printed on the face of the card.</p>
    <p> If your purchase, membership plan or subscription involves a recurring payment of a fee, unless you notify us
        before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to automatically renew your membership or subscription,
        you understand it will automatically continue and you authorize us, or a third party through which you transact
        (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable fees and any taxes,
        using any credit card we have on record for you.</p>
    <p> If all credit cards we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership or subscription fees, we
        may cancel your subscription, as applicable, unless you provide us with a new credit card. If you provide us
        with a new credit card and are successfully charged before your subscription is canceled, your new subscription
        period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>
    <h3>Subscription Cancellation</h3>
    <p> You may cancel any subscriptions by visiting your account details page provided on sentiment.fyi (your "Account
        Details") and adjusting your subscription preferences, or by contacting our Customer Service team. If you cancel
        your subscription, you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid, nor will you receive a refund of any
        Credits purchased. Your subscription benefits terminate when your subscription is canceled, but cancellation
        does not terminate your license and access to purchased content or otherwise affect your ability to utilize SNT
        Credits that have accrued in your account.</p>
    <h3>Promotional Trial Memberships</h3>
    <p> We sometimes offer certain customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to the
        Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
        determine your eligibility. Trial members may, at any time (through your Account Details), choose not to
        continue to paid membership by canceling prior to the end of the trial period. If a trial offer or a promotion
        requires you to have a valid payment instrument on file, such as a credit card or other permitted payment
        method, we may validate that payment method including by requesting a temporary authorization from the financial
        institution issuing your payment instrument. If we determine that your payment instrument is invalid, without
        limiting any of our other rights, we may revoke any benefits, Credits or Content you may have received as part
        of the offer.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Third Party Services/Third Party Services</h2>
    <p> The Service may contain links to other websites ("Linked Services"). The Linked Services are not under the
        control of Sentiment and Sentiment is not responsible for the contents of any Linked Service, including without
        limitation any link contained in a Linked Service, or any changes or updates to a Linked Service. Sentiment is
        providing these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by
        Sentiment of the site or any association with its operators.
    </p>
    <p> Certain services made available via the Service are delivered by third party sites and organizations. By using
        any product, service or functionality originating from the Service domain, you hereby acknowledge and consent
        that Sentiment may share such information and data with any third party with whom Sentiment has a contractual
        relationship to provide the requested product, service or functionality on behalf of the Service users and
        customers.
    </p>

        accordance with these terms of use. As a condition of your use of the Service, you warrant to Sentiment that you
        will not use the Service for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. You may not use the

        works, or in any way exploit any of the content, in whole or in part, found on the Service. Sentiment content is

        reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time without
        notice for any reason whatsoever. </p>
    <p> Sentiment reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable
        law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information
        or materials, in whole or in part, in Sentiment's sole discretion. </p>
    <p> Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any
        Communication Service. Sentiment does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any
        Communication Service and, therefore, Sentiment specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the
        Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers
        and hosts are not authorized Sentiment spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of
        Sentiment. </p>
    <p>Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or
        dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload the materials. </p>

    <h2>Materials Provided to the Service or Posted on Any Sentiment System</h2>
    <p> Sentiment does not claim ownership of the materials you (a) provide to the Service (including feedback and
        suggestions) or (b) post, upload, input or submit to any Sentiment Service or our associated services
        (collectively "Content"). </p>
    <p> However, by posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Content you are granting Sentiment and
        its successors, our affiliated companies and necessary sublicensees a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
        sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, edit, translate, reformat,
        distribute, transmit, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and
        Sentiment’s (and its successors' and Affiliates') business, including for the purpose of promoting and
        redistributing part or all of the Service and to publish your name and avatar image in connection with your
        Content. </p>
    <h3>License to Other Users</h3>
    <p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your
        Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative
        works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as embeds). For clarity, this
        license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the
        Service. </p>
    <h3>Right to Monetize</h3>
    <p> You grant to Sentiment the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include
        displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to
        any payments, and no compensation will be paid with respect to the use of your Content, as provided herein.
        Sentiment is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and may remove any Submission at
        any time in Sentiment's sole discretion. </p>
    <p> By posting, uploading, inputting, providing or submitting your Submission you warrant and represent that you own
        or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission as described in this section including, without
        limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the Submissions. </p>
    <h3>Third Party Accounts</h3>
    <p> You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having a <a
            href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">Google account</a>. However, you do need a Google account to
        use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to post
        Content or vote on Content, and more. You can follow these instructions to <a
                href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp">create
            a Google account</a>.</p>
    <p>To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google account
        password on third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, including what to do
        if you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or Google account. </p>
    <p>You will be able to connect your Sentiment account to third party accounts. By connecting your Sentiment account
        to your third party account, you acknowledge and agree that you are consenting to the continuous release of
        information about you to others (in accordance with your privacy settings on those third party sites). If you do
        not want information about you to be shared in this manner, do not use this feature. </p>
    <h2>Accuracy of Billing and Account Information</h2>
    <p> We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
        services purchased. These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same
        credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event that we make a change
        to or cancel an order or subscription, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing
        address/phone number provided at the time the order or subscription was made. We reserve the right to limit or
        prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors. </p>
    <p> You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made at
        our Service. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and
        credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as
        needed. </p>
    <h3>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h3>
    <p> You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service
        at any time, without notice to you. </p>
    <p> Prices for our products are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right at any time to modify or
        discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time. We shall not be liable to
        you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. </p>
    <p> We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or services to any person,
        geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. </p>
    <p> We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of
        products or product pricing or service pricing are subject to change at anytime without notice, at the sole
        discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product or service at any time. </p>
    <p> We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or
        obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected. </p>
    <p> Any offer for any product or service made on this Service is void where prohibited. </p>
    <h3>Termination/Access Restriction</h3>
    <p> These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. Sentiment reserves the
        right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Service and the related services or any portion
        thereof at any time, without notice. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that
        you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site. </p>
    <p> To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and you
        hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Delaware in all disputes arising out of or
        relating to the use of the Service. Use of the Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give
        effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section. </p>
    <p> You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
        Sentiment as a result of this agreement or use of the Service. Sentiment's performance of this agreement is
        subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of
        Sentiment's right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to
        your use of the Service or information provided to or gathered by Sentiment with respect to such use. If any
        part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but
        not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or
        unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
        the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. </p>
    <p> The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the
        termination of this agreement for all purposes. </p>
    <p> If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of
        these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain
        liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access
        to our Services (or any part thereof). </p>

    <h3>Arbitration</h3>
    <p> In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these
        Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for
        damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant
        to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American
        Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed
        upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court
        having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or
        concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
        attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions
        or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or indirectly, including

        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and
        enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision
        shall survive the termination of these Terms and Conditions. </p>

        class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS

        CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION
        AGAINST THE OTHER. Further, unless both you and Sentiment agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate
        more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
        proceeding. </p>
